File template.dfd is an example dfs input file
which can be modified to suit a given problem.  Its flow
field can be viewed by opening (with xv, for example)
template.bitmap.

Directory IEA_annex20/isotherm contains a model corresponding to
an IEA Annex 20 test case under 2D, isothermal conditions. These
are older model format files.

Directory IEA_annex20/nonisotherm contains a model corresponding to
an IEA Annex 20 test case under 2D, nonisothermal conditions. These
are older model format files.

THE ABOVE PROBLEMS REQUIRE dfs ONLY.

Directory ROOMVENT98 encompasses both CFD-only and BSim-CFD
coupled simulations. Note: older model format files in the
folder.

Directory rad_htg contains a radiant heating example,
with models for the CFD active and not active cases.

cfd_benchmark is for training workshops and includes a model
without a domain, a model with a partially completed as well
as a working coupled model.
