This model describes an L-shaped office comprising 7 walls, 1 ceiling,
1 floor, 3 doors and 2 windows with explicit shading/insolation
consideration. The zone is conditioned via a convective heating
system and ideal controller.


Notes on simple 1 zone building model with external shading,
convective heating and ideal control:

This model (bld_simple.cfg) relates to an L-shaped
reception with convective heating.  The simple representation
contains a single thermal zone, but the resolution of the
model has been increased by including a shading and
insolation analysis.

The obstructions represent an adjacent building.  Several
obstructions are used to represent adjacent buildings and
a tree. 

The following files are used in this example problem.
