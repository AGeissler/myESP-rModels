This model describes an L-shaped office comprising 7 walls, 1 ceiling,
1 floor, 3 doors and 2 windows with shading/insolation determined at
simulation time. The zone is conditioned via a convective heating
system and ideal controller. The external obstructions represent adjacent
buildings and vegetation. The model comprises the following files.

embedded_SI.cfg   model configuration
embedded_SI.ctl   control system
embedded_SI.log   project notes (this file)
office.geo       zone geometry
office.con       zone construction
office.opr       zone schedules
office.tmc       zone transparent properties
office.obs       zone obstructions file
